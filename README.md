1. [Master_Thesis](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/tree/main/Master_Thesis) folder contains my Thesis **The Effect of Losing a Parent on Children's Educational Development**. supervised by Warn N. Lekfuangfu.
  
          Abstract: This research examines how the loss of a parent affects children’s academic performance
          in developing countries such as Ethiopia, Peru, Vietnam, and India. Due to limited
          data, the study uses various methods to reveal causal relationships and their differences
          among gender and age groups. The study focuses on standardized test scores and uses a
          staggered difference-in-difference methodology to determine causality. However, the primary
          objective is to uncover how the effects of parental loss vary by gender and age. The
          study shows significant gender differences and emphasizes the importance
          of the timing of parental loss. Future research directions include investigating parental education levels' impact and exploring parental loss's 
          influence on educational attainment. This research contributes to the literature on parental absence
          and its consequences, providing insights into education and economic development policies.

2. [R_ML_project](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/tree/main/R_ML_project)  folder contains the final project of the graduate course in ***Causal Inference and Machine Learning (CIML)*** at UC3M. In this folder, the following files can be found:

* The file [CIML_Sergio_Blanco_Piñeiro](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/blob/main/R_ML_project/CIML_Sergio_Blanco_Pi%C3%B1eiro.pdf) is the final research project whose title is **The Sensitivity of an Empirical Model of Married Women’s Hours of Work to
Economic and Statistical Assumptions**

       Abstract: The goal is to follow Mroz’s multistage procedure to estimate a structural labor
       supply equation. This study will employ the data set used in Mroz (1987), which contains data
       for 753 working-age, married, women, in 1975. The data set is a Cross-section of data
       originating from the 1976 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), based on data for
       the previous year, 1975.

* The file [mroz.des.txt](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/blob/main/R_ML_project/mroz.des.txt) contains information related to the variables used in this analysis
* The file [mroz.dta](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/blob/main/R_ML_project/mroz.dta) contains the raw data used in Mroz (1987)
* The file [Project.Rmd](https://github.com/sbp-stats/sbp_portfolio/blob/main/R_ML_project/Project.Rmd) is the commented code of this project in and .Rmd file
